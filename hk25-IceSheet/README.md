# Precipitation over ice-sheets (hk25-IceSheet)

Mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is an important contributor for current and future sea level rise. To properly drive the surface mass balance calculations in ice sheet models, a realistic simulation of precipitation and surface temperatures is crucial. Regional modeling studies suggest that higher resolution of the atmospheric models driving ice sheet models improves the simulation of processes occurring at the steep margins of the ice sheets, making km-scale global models a promising tool for future coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet modelling as planned for example in the [TerraDT](https://terradt.eu/) project.

In this team we want to compare the simulated surface meteorology over Greenland and Antarctica for participating models and with reanalysis data and observations to assess how suited the models are to drive ice-sheet models.

### starting exercises: 

- plot annual mean precipitation and temperature over Greenland broken down into solid and fluid for the different models (and Reanalysis);
- integrated precipitation over Greenland (Antarctica) from models and reanalysis
- Identify moist / warm air intrusions into the Arctic => feature tracking requires data stored as netcdf, there is an algorithm available.
- surface energy balance
- Satellite observations? precipitation products do not work > 60Â°, see paper provided by Hauke

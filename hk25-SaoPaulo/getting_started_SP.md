# Getting Started – São Paulo Node

## About this Node

This document provides instructions for accessing datasets stored locally by the São Paulo team, hosted on servers at **IAG/USP (Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences, University of São Paulo)**.

---

## Data Location

The datasets are stored on three local servers at IAG/USP. To optimize resource usage, each São Paulo node team member will be assigned to a specific server — this distribution will be finalized on Monday during the event. Login credentials have already been sent via email.

After logging in, navigate to: `/dados/hackathon` to access the datasets.
